          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Hey, I’m <span className="font-semibold text-purple-600">Tito</span> — a full-stack web developer and creative with a passion for both building apps and making content.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            I recently completed the <span className="font-semibold">Per Scholas Software Engineering Bootcamp</span>, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and built full-stack apps from the ground up.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Outside of code, I’ve spent years as a <span className="font-semibold">DJ and content creator</span>, blending music with visuals — and now I’m doing the same with gaming videos and original music on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            My goal is to work remotely in a collaborative dev environment, keep leveling up my skills, and maybe one day lead my own tech + media projects. Let’s connect!
          </p>
